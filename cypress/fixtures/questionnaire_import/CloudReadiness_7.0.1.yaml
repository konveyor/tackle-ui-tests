            text: Legacy Monolithic Application
            risk: red
            rationale: Legacy monoliths are challenging for cloud adaptation.
            mitigation: Consider refactoring into microservices.
      - order: 2
        text: Does your application use a microservices architecture?
        explanation: Assess if the application is built using a microservices architecture.
        answers:
          - order: 1
            text: Yes
            risk: green
            rationale: Microservices are well-suited for cloud environments.
            mitigation: Continue monitoring service dependencies.
          - order: 2
            text: No
            risk: yellow
            rationale: Non-microservices architectures may face scalability issues.
            mitigation: Assess the feasibility of transitioning to microservices.
          - order: 3
            text: Unknown
            risk: unknown
            rationale: Lack of clarity on architecture can lead to unplanned issues.
            mitigation: Conduct an architectural review.

      - order: 3
        text: Is your application's data storage cloud-optimized?
        explanation: Evaluate if the data storage solution is optimized for cloud usage.
