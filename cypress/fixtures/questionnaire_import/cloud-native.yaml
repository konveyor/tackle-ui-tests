    name: Application technologies 1
    questions:
      - text: What is the main technology in your application?
        explanation: What would you describe as the main framework used to build your application.
        answers:
          - text: Unknown
            rationale: This is a problem because of the uncertainty.
            mitigation: Gathering more information about this is required.
