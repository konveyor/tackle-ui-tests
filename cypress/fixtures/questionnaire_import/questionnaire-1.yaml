        text: Does the application have legal and/or licensing requirements?
        explanation: >-
          Legal and licensing requirements must be assessed to determine their
          possible impact (cost, fault reporting) on the container platform
          hosting the application. Examples of legal requirements: isolated
          clusters, certifications, compliance with the Payment Card Industry
          Data Security Standard or the Health Insurance Portability and
          Accountability Act. Examples of licensing requirements: per server,
          per CPU.
